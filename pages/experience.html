        <h3>Technology I've Experience With</h3>
        <p>Coding isn’t new to me because I’ve done it in grade 9 but sadly forgot everything about it because I didn’t take it in grade 10. But in grade 9 I also learn about the basics of photoshop and also going to grade 10 I learn more about photoshop. I would say I understand how to use photoshop but I’m nowhere near a good level to call myself a pro. I still use photoshop now for making logos and making my own youtube thumbnails. Another adobe program I’ve learned to use was Adobe Premiere. I wanted to learn how to use this programs to edit my videos. I’m still a beginner at Premiere because I learn it a few months ago from youtube tutorials, also I’ve only edited one video off this program. I still have much to learn from these programs but have the basic understanding to learn more. </p>

    <h3>Things I want to Learn</h3>
    <p>Programs I want to advance my knowledge on would mainly be Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere just because they can help me with my youtube and steaming career if I wanted to go in that direction. Also knowing how to work with these programs can benefit you if you ever want to become a graphic designer and make a video to promote your work and learning these programs could give you a reputation in the industry. This could also help in the future with electrical engineering because you can design the house with your photoshop skill and go in-depth about the wiring in the house.
