    <h3>My Interest</h3>
    <p>Things I enjoy doing would be playing basketball. I enjoy playing basketball because it’s a fun sport where you can play with your friends, it’s also entertaining to watch and I like playing 2k which is a  basketball game. In the summer I spend a lot of time with friends playing basketball. A player I enjoy watching would be Kevin Durant, I like him as a player because he is as tall as a center doing things a point guard can do. He also just came back with a serious injury but is still playing really well in the season right now. Basketball isn’t the only thing I enjoy doing, I also liked music. The genres I enjoy listening to would be Rap, RnB, Pop songs. An artist right now I listen to frequently would be The Kid Laroi. I listen to it because I enjoy his songs he makes and also he has a nice voice. The thing that amazes me about him is that he is only 17 years old doing all this. He one of those artists that producing hit after hit and this is why enjoy listening to his music because I know his next song going to be a hit. Another things I also enjoy doing would be watching Anime. I love anime because as a kid a grow up watching it. The first anime I’ve ever watched was Dragon Ball Z and Naruto which are very well known today. I enjoy these type of shows because the storyline and the character development throughout the show is very good. Also, the opening songs and endings to this show be fire and enjoyable to listen to. Watching anime just makes me things about the enjoyable time I had as a child.</p>
