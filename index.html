    <h3>My Interest</h3>
    <p>Things I enjoy doing would be playing basketball. I enjoy playing basketball because it’s a fun sport that I can play with my friends. It’s also entertaining to watch and I like playing 2k which is a basketball game. In the summer I spent a lot of time with friends playing basketball. A player I enjoy watching would be Kevin Durant, I like him as a player because he is as tall as a center doing things a point guard can do. He also just came back with a serious injury but is still playing really well in the season right now. Basketball isn’t the only thing I enjoy doing, I also like music. The genres I enjoy listening to are Rap, RnB, and Pop. An artist right now frequently listen to is The Kid Laroi. I listen to it because I enjoy his songs he makes and also he has a nice voice. The thing that amazes me about him is that he is only 17 years old doing all this. He is one of those artists that produces hit after hit. Another thing I also enjoy doing is watching Anime. I love anime because I grew up watching it as a kid. The first anime I’ve ever watched was Dragon Ball Z and Naruto which are very well known today. I enjoy these type of shows because the storyline and the character development throughout the show is very good. Also, the opening songs and endings to this show be fire and enjoyable to listen to. Watching anime just makes me things about the enjoyable time I had as a child.</p>
